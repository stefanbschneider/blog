Hi, I am Stefan. 
I hold a computer science Ph.D. and am passionate about learning new things.
I use this blog to take notes for myself - and possibly help others.

Contact details and more information about myself are on my [website](https://stefanbschneider.github.io/).

I created this blog using [Quarto](https://quarto.org/).
